      <br>
      <p>I'm Orion, and I work as a mid level software developer for HalloweenCostumes.com. I'm a full stack developer, but until recently have leaned heavily towards backend development (so please don't make fun of me for this web page, I'm working on it...). I work primary in .NET, but write most of my hobby projects in go. For client side work I use Svelte, Typescript, and MVC Razor pages</p>
      <p>I use docker to deploy, and work on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS. I love the terminal. I love vim bindings. I have a conflicted relationship with DevOps.</p>
      <p>Please, grab some coffee, click around, have a good time. Feel free to email me at orion.callaghan@gmail.com.</p>
